# Doggy Digs

A sample search app which can help you locate a new companion.

## Running Locally

- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to start the application

## Additional work needed

There are a number of things that can be improved in this project. I set a time limit and told myself to stop after getting the base functionality in place.

- Improve the ability to search by location given a city, state, and radius.
- Add nicer loading and error states.
- Add transitions to cards
- Evaluate A11y and improve any accessibility issues
- Make logout work
